# Commidity-Price-Prediction-In-AP_Project

Commodity price forecasting is a critical endeavor in today's dynamic 
economic landscape. This research delves into the accurate prediction of two 
vital commodities within Andhra Pradesh, India: petrol and electricity. These 
commodities are essential to our daily life and industry, subject to 
multifaceted influences. Leveraging the XGBoost algorithm's powerful 
predictive capabilities, we meticulously collect and analyze data, including 
factors like crude oil prices, exchange rates, tariffs, and coal prices, which 
impact these commodities. The project aims to enhance understanding of 
price dynamics and provide practical implications for energy management, 
economic planning, and investment decisions. These insights gained have 
practical implications for different industrial sectors, thereby offering 
tangible benefits to stakeholders in Andhra Pradesh's commodities market. 
The results show that using price influencing features can improve XGBoost 
model prediction accuracy than base models built on historical price data.
